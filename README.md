Answer to section 5: 
The benefits and disadvantages the usage of MongoDB provides in this example over relational databases like MS-SQL:
Benefits:
For this example:

•	the entire setup is cheap and lightweight, and so it would be easier to sell.
•	Management - MongoDB does not require a database administrator since it is handier in this way, it can be used both by developers and administrators.

General benefits in addition:

•	Dynamic schema: flexibility to change the data schema without modifying any of the existing data. (E.g. adding properties to the data model after data has been inserted to the database is possible). 
•	Speed: high performance for simple queries.
•	Flexibility - You can add new columns / fields on MongoDB without affecting existing rows or application performance
•	Scalability - MongoDB is horizontally scalable, which easily helps reducing the workload and scaling a business.
•	In a relational database, Handling tables across different servers is difficult. Complexity: requires an administrator. Relational database data has to fit into existing table. If some new data does not fit into the existing tables, then the database structure has to be designed to fit changes and that is complex and difficult to handle.
•	JSON Query language – readable by the developer.
•	Opensource, cheap, costs less.

Disadvantages (or advantages of a relational DB over MongoDB):
•	Join – when required it’s an advantage to a relational database over NoSQL.
•	Relations – when required it’s an advantage to a relational database over NoSQL.

Answer to section 6:
